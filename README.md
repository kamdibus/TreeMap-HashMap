# TreeMap-HashMap

Tree and hash based associative data structures implemented to meet requirements of over a hundred unit tests preimplemented with boost.

## Efficiency tests

Project uses chrono library to test how long does it take to respectively insert and find elements in tree and hash maps.

## Implementation

Algorithms applayed in this project are strongly based on the ones put forward in Thomas H. Cormen's "Introduction to Algorithms".
